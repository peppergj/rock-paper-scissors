rock scissors paper bot (WIP)

greetings traveller
i met elon musk and he said he'd make me the CEO of tesla for making this incredibly ornate piece of art
i have acquired the skills after years of master coding and finding and experimenting with different methods 
so i have used my big incredibly large vocabulary of python for this very finely tweaked carefully put together piece of the bron jame modern art

the RSP bot. 
the one and only.
rock scissors paper bot.

thank you for your time
